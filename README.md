This time, I've actually forked this project and did my own changes (most of the changes there were mine either way...) since the my updates to it took way too long to be implemented.

What has been fixed so far:

* **Two Player Functionality** pretty much everywhere
* Added **Quality of Life** changes
  * Added **Inverted Controls** for ScreenSelectMusic/Course **Acceleration**
  * **Questions Acceleration** if X-Mods are already used in Courses
  * **Force Implimentation** of **Noteskin** and selected **Accelerator** in Course/Extra Mode
* **Maximum Lives** forcibly set to **100**

Stuff still might need to get fixed and a few more QoL changes need to be implemented, but because of no interest, this project is halted (for now).
